# 🧠 Mental Health Detection

This project is a web-based system developed using **Flask** and **Machine Learning** to predict an individual's mental health condition based on survey responses. It was created as part of an academic submission at **KIIT Deemed to be University**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze mental health using ML models.
- Compare and evaluate different ML algorithms.
- Collect and enhance survey data for predictions.
- Build a user-friendly web interface using Flask.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models Evaluated

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naïve Bayes (NB)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – selected model (~92% accuracy)

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time mental health predictions
- Web interface for user assessments
- Lightweight Flask-based server
